Lagerregal
==========

Lagerregal is a somewhat flexible inventory system. Mostly designed to work
best for my workplace, but it should be easily customizable to your needs.

Label Printing
===============

1. Create necessary label templates with the official software and put them in static/.

2. Set `ALLOWED_INCLUDE_ROOTS = ('/path/to/static/dir',) ` in settings.py to the absolute location of that static folder.

3. Set the `LABEL_TEMPLATES`, Example:

```
LABEL_TEMPLATES = {
    "sample_department": {
        "device": [
            "/path/to/Lagerregal/static/labels/device.label",
            ["data","keys","to", "use","in","label"] ]
        "room": [
            "/path/to/Lagerregal/static/labels/room.label",
            ["data","keys","to", "use","in","label"] ]
    }
}
```
